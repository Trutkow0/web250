  <h2>Course Contract</h2>
  
  <p class="contract"> I, <a href="introduction.html">Timothy E. Rutkowski</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2025 WEB250-N850 Database Driven Websites with my instructor, D.I von Briesen.
    I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world.
    I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.
    As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
  </p> 
                        
  <p class="contract">Signed: <i>Timothy E. Rutkowski, 14 January 2025</i></p>
